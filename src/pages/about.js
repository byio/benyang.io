      Hi! I'm a fullstack Javascript developer, which means I build both the frontend and backend of web applications. Being familiar with both the entire technology stack of an application grants me a broader perspective on how every aspect of an application ties into one another, thus allowing me to make more big picture decisions regarding performance and cost efficiency. This insight is why I strived to learn the skills needed as a fullstack developer.
